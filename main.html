		<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
		<p>I want to be a software developer because designing computer programs lets me use my creative and problem-solving skills. 
			Software development wasn't my initial career path, but I'm glad I discovered it. In college, I originally studied Mechanical. 
			After obtaining my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, I took up a job as a customer service associate at Amazon. 
			I was responsible for addressing customer's concerns and resolving their issues. 
			While I was good at my job and worked hard, the position didn't excite me, so I searched for something more fulfilling.
			Also, Software developers are in high demand and the pay is also pretty attractive with many growth opportunities.
